## Evaluation

One digital humanities project that I’ve been interested in, since before I even knew what digital humanities was, is the project Every Noise at Once. The idea behind the project is that there are thousands of different genres of music all across the world, varying in both geographical and cultural origins, which might affect the instrumentation or overall feeling of the piece, to musical genres within a certain location that are just as different from one another as 
French music is from Japanese music. The aim of Every Noise at Once is to present all of the different genres of music to the viewer in a way that makes sense and is easy to understand, while also providing links for the viewer to listen to the different types of music. The makeup of the project is a big scatterplot with all different genres of music, with one axis being organic/mechanical and the other being atmospheric/bouncy. The different genres range in everything from Norwegian Contemporary Jazz to Throat Singing to Industrial Grime, and everything in between. If you click on one of the genres, you can then see another map of the artists that fall within that genre, and you can listen to their music. The project takes its data from Spotify’s categorization algorithm, which is what sorts these artists and songs into all kinds of super niche genres. 
	The project was created by Glenn McDonald while working at EchoNest, a music intelligence company that was bought out by Spotify. While originally created as a debugging tool, the website can answer some really interesting questions about the state of music itself. While some music genres have relatively clear demarcations, such as New Wave or German Baroque Choir, the algorithm also finds new ways to categorize and group relatively less popular music into groups with somewhat arbitrary names, such as “Bloco” or “Escape Room,” names chosen by the developers as their own reactions to hearing the music. These algorithmic categorizations can help link music that may have been developed under no clear umbrella into one group, and give an identity to both older, less popular music, or new musical genres coming up on the horizon.  
	I think one major strength of this project is presenting the data in a very clear and simple way—the project really is just a webpage that is a scatterplot with all of the different genres of music, and links to playlists and artist maps. It is incredibly readable and understandable, and does not hide itself under jargon and academic graphs, which is great for the average user interested in music and categorization. There are also twenty or so links to smaller projects created from the main dataframe, which are all interesting to peruse and get more information about. I think, while this project is very good, the one thing that could be improved upon is how the data is presented visually—perhaps adding gridlines to the graph, and creating a more understandable color-coding scheme would help the viewer understand what it all means at a first glance, as opposed to having to guess. But otherwise, I think the project is really strong, and does what it wants to do well. 

	Also, an interesting side note: one of the smaller projects on the site is looking at listening habits by school. Looking at Tufts University, you can see that our top genres are Indie Pop, Indie Rock, Alternative R&B, Bubblegrunge, and Modern Rock. Our most similar universities by listening habits are Harvard, Washington University in St. Louis, Northwestern, and Virginia Commonwealth University. A playlist to our top songs is also linked. Compare this to a school like Texas A&M, whose top genres are Texas Country, Red Dirt, Anthem Worship, and CCM, whatever that means. Their most similar schools are Oklahoma State, Texas Tech, and Tarleton State.
