        NEWS FROM NOWHERE OR AN EPOCH OF REST.

        <hi>U</hi>p at the League,
        says a friend, teiHeaderhad been one night
        a brisk conversa-
        tional discussion,
        as to what wouldhappen on the 
        Morrow of the Re-
        volution, finally 
        shading off into a vigorous statement by
        various friends, of their views on the future
        of the fully-developed new society.

        <hi>S</hi>ays our friend: Consider-
        ing the subject, the discus-
        sion was good-tempered
        for those present, being used
        to public meetings and after-
        lecture debates, if they did 
        not listen to each other's opinions, which
        could scarcely be expected of them, at all
        events did not always attempt to speak
        all together, as is the custom of people in
        ordinary polite society when conversing
