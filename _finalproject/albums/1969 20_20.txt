It's automatic when I talk with old friends
The conversation turns to girls we knew
When their hair was soft and long
And the beach was the place to go

With suntanned bodies and waves of sunshine
The California girls and a beautiful coastline
And warmed-up weather, let's
Get together and do it again
Do-do-do, do-do-do
Do, do-do-do-do
Do-do-do, do-do-do
Do, do-do-do-do
Do-do-do, do-do-do
Dum-de-doo-ron
Do-do-do, do-do-do
Do, do-do-do-do

With a girl, the lonely sea looks good
With moonlight
Makes your night times warm
And out of sight (Been so long)
Do, do, do-do-do (Been so long)
Do, do, do-do-do (So long, been so long)
Been so long

Hey now, hey now, hey now, hey now
Hey now, hey now, hey now, hey now
Hey now, hey now, hey now, hey now

Well, I've been thinking 'bout all the places
We surfed and danced and all the faces
We miss, so let's get
Back together and do it again
(Come and do it)

Ahhhhhh oooooo

This is the way
I always dreamed it would be
The way that it is, oh oh
When you are holding me
I never had a love of my own
Maybe that's why when we're all alone
I can hear music
I can hear music
The sound of the city baby seems to disappear
I can hear music
Sweet sweet music
Whenever you touch me baby
Whenever you're near

Loving you
It keeps me satisfied
And I can't explain, oh no
The way I'm feeling inside
You look at me we kiss and then
I close my eyes and here it comes again

Bluebirds over the mountain
Seagulls over the sea-ea-ea
Bluebirds over the mountain
Bring my baby to me

A boy and a girl they once found love
To each it seemed like heaven above
He looked into her eyes and said
Ooo wee baby you're so good for my head

Oh everyone in every land
Please give me a helping hand
If you see her all alone
Oh tell my baby "won't you please come home?"


Oh bring my baby back
I don't know why she's been so long
But all I know is that she's gone
Oh bring my baby back to me
Well I'm in pain can't you see
A boy and a girl they once found love
To each it seemed like heaven above
I guess that's why we fell in love
And now she's gone and all I have to say is


Bring my baby
Oooo Baby

You're going out tonight
You put your real cool-looking clothes on
You're getting uptight
About some little thing I said
All that I said
"I couldn't play the game"
It shouldn't make any
Difference to you

Go walking around, now
The wind's really blowing
It's too cold to talk
I wonder if she's knowing?
She should be with me
It could set her free
Come with me, be with me
A part of me

When I was a little bitty baby
My mama done rock me in the cradle
In them old cotton fields back home
It was back in Louisiana
Just about a mile from Texarkana
In them old cotton fields back home

Let me tell you now well got me in a fix
I caught a nail in my tire doing lickity splits
I had to walk a long long way to town
Came upon a nice old man well he had a hat on
Wait a minute mister can you give me some directions
I going to want to be right off for home
Don't care if them cotton balls get rotten
When I got you baby, who needs cotton
In them old cotton fields back home
Brother only one thing more that's going to warm you
A summer's day out in California
It's going to be those cotton fields back home

It was back in Louisiana
Just about a mile from Texarkana
Give me them cotton fields
(It was back in Louisiana)
Let me hear it for the cotton fields
(Just about a mile from Texarkana)
You know that there's just no place like home

Well boy it sure feels good to breathe the air back home
You should have seen their faces when they seen how I grown

I took a walk and sat down in a park
The gardener walked out and the sprinklers went on
They watered the lawn and I went to sleep

Ten thirty I turned my radio on
Some group was playing a musical song
It wasn't too long and I went to sleep

Again at the park on a nice summer day
High up above me the trees gently sway
A bird flew away and I went to sleepYou might also like

I looked at you baby
And what did I see

Made me feel so warm inside

Time to get alone
To get alone
And just be together
We'll only be together

Come and do a couple days
Just a ways
Away from the people
And safe from the people

The pine-scented air
Smells so good in the snow
In our toboggan we'll go
Screaming down the mountainside
The touch of your cheeks
When they're rosy and cold
Feels so cozy to hold
Just to take you close
And make you warm and

Cabin essence timely hello

Nestle in a kiss below there
The constellations ebb and flow there
And witness our home on the range...
