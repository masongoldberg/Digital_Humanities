To get you baby, I went through the wringer
Ain't gonna let you slip through my fingers
Going to school isn't my fondest desire
But sitting in class, she set my soul on fire
God please let us go on this way

All day long I practiced what to say-ay
I think about this game that I like to play-ay
When I leave you I'm so depressed
'Cause you're my only happiness
God please let us go on this way
Seems we have extra-sensory perception
You can send me thoughts, I'd have no objection
Now we can fly high in the sky
We'll live forever, we'll never die

God please let us go on this way-ay
(God please let us go on)
God please let us go on this way-ay
(God please let us go on)
God please let us go on this way-ay
(God please let us go on)
God don't let her slip through my fingers

Well she's a roller skating child with a ribbon in her hair
She gets my heart to beatin' when I see her there
You know my heart starts smiling when she sings
She's such an angel, I bet she's got wings

And we'll make sweet lovin' when the sun goes down
We'll even do more when your mama's not around
Well, oh my, oh gosh oh gee
She really sends chills inside of me
They've got a record playing in the skating rink
She comes skating past me and she gives me a wink
I go and get my skates on and I catch up with her
We do it holding hands, it's so cold I go "brrr"

And we'll make sweet lovin' when the sun goes down
We'll even do more when your mama's not around
Well, oh my, oh gosh oh gee
She really sends chills inside of me

Round and around and around we go
The music keeps me on my feet
It's sweet, it's sweet, it's sweeter than honey
When we're walking down the street
(That's right, hey!)

We run in to the kitchen and we grab a bite
Her folks let me stay with her 'til late at night
So many guys want a girl like mine
A love like this happens only one time

And we'll make sweet lovin' when the sun goes down
We'll even do more when your mama's not around
Well, oh my, oh gosh oh gee
She really sends chills inside of me

My girlfriend Betty, she's always ready
To help me in any way
She'll do my cooking, she's always looking
For ways she can make my day
And when I'm looking at her, the sound of pitter patter
On rainy days like today
Could get you feeling warmer
And you know what-a that can lead to

Maybe it won't last but what do we care
My baby and I just want a good time
Might go up in smoke now but what do we care

My girlfriend Penny, she's kind of skinny
And so she needs her falsies on
She don't like cooking but she's so good looking

Especially when we're dancing close
She'll do the dirty boogie
And that's when I go up in smoke

Maybe it won't last but what do we care

Trying, trying to get past them cars

Got a, got a little date with an angel
She's the one that said she'd go with me
To see a little movie tonight
(Honk honk, honkin' down the highway)
Her folks told me that she's lonely
And she loves me only
She's used to running away from guys
Praying, praying that she'll hold me tight (woo!)
And hoping, hoping that she'll see the light

Who cares if I got to spend my money
Even if I have to act funny
To go and steal her heart away
(Honk honk, honkin' down the highway)
Take it one little inch at a time now
Until we're feeling fine now
I guess I've got a way with girls

The night was so young and everything still
The moon shining bright on my window sill
I think of her lips, it chills me inside
And then I think why does she have to hide

Is somebody gonna tell me why she has to hi-i-ide?
She's passing it by, she won't even try
To make this love go where it should
Doo do doo do do
The sky's turning grey, there's clouds overhead
I'm still not asleep, I'm in my bed
I think of her eyes and it makes me sigh
I think of her voice and it makes me cry

Is somebody gonna tell me why she has to lie-i-ie?
She'd be so right to hold me tonight
Love was made for her and I
Doo do doo do do

It's three o'clock, I go to my sink
I pour some milk and I start to think
Is she asleep or is she awake?
And does she think of the love we could make?

Wake up, call me baby, call me
Tell me what's on your mind
I've got a car and you're not too far
Please let me come over to you
Doo do doo do do

I don't want to tell you that I care for you
And have you just ignore me
It's better that I wait and see just how you feel
And maybe you'll adore me

That you don't need another person in your life
I know it may sound funny
But you're the kind of woman
Who'd make a very sweet wife
Take your time, don't worry how you feel because
You know we've got forever

You'd think that I was clever
I've never had someone I need someone

Feed you breakfast from a little cup
I want to pick you up
Rock you back and forth and make you smile
I want to hold you close for a while

I want to tickle your feet
Drop you in your little tub
Wash your body and shampoo your hair
Be careful not to sting your eyes

When it's night, I'll put you in your bed
And I'll bend and kiss you on your head

Over the city in an airplane
I can see everything below
The houses they look so tiny
The cars look like dots
We've only got fifteen minutes to go
The clouds in the sky caress my mind so tenderly
The sun shines down on the great big beautiful sea

The sound of the engine fills my ears up
I'm hoping this rainy weather clears up
My lover is waiting at the airport
Soon she'll be kissing me hello
The woman sitting next to me tells me 'bout her guy
And I tell her all about you and I
Airplane, airplane
