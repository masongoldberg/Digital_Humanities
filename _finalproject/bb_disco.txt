This time each year in our hometown
The county fair comes our way
Where the folks gather round to be happy and spend their day
A-here's what happened now
I soon decide that I'd take with me
The most specialest girl I knew
I had her pack us a lunch and on down the dirt road we flew

Folk: "Hurry hurry, step right up and win your girl a stuffed koala bear!"
Girl: "Aw, come on Nicky, win me a koala bear!"
Folk: "Break the balloon with a dart! Yes, you son, come up here! Win your girl a stuffed koala bear!
Girl: "Oh please, win me a koala bear!"
Folk: "Break the balloon with a dart! Come on son, step right up! Get up there, that's a boy!"
Right then I knew what I had to do
(Hurry, hurry)
Before that day was through
(Step right up)
I had to win a stuffed doggie or I'd break her poor heart in two
(Hurry, hurry)
(Win a prize)
A-let me tell you now
I passed up a chance when I walked by a booth
(Hurry, hurry)
Where you throw a dart and break a balloon
(Step right up)
I snuck by a couple more, but I had to get caught real soon
(Hurry, hurry)
(Win a prize)

Folk: "Step right up, test your strength! Come on, son, ring the bell with the hammer!"
Girl: "Aww, come on, muscles!"
Folk: "Win your girl a stuffed koala bear!"
Girl: "Ooohhh!"
Folk: "Come on son, are you a man or a weakling? Yes, you, step up here and test your strength! Win your girl a stuffed koala bear!"
Girl: "Come on, baby!"
Folk: "Come on, son!"

I hit the rubber stump just as hard as I could
(Hurry, hurry)
But I didn't make it ring the bell
(Step right up)
I tried again and again, but I just didn't do so well
(Hurry, hurry)
(Win a prize)
Can you believe it now
Up walked a fellow and he tapped me on the shoulder, said
(Hurry, hurry)
"I can win your girl a prize"
(Step right up)
So he flexed all his muscles and he knocked the bell up in the sky
(Hurry, hurry)
(Win a prize)

Yeah the big strong guy knocked the bell in the sky
(Hurry, hurry)
Took my girl and the doggie away
(Step right up)
Yeah the big strong guy knocked the bell in the sky
(Folk: "Step right up son, test your strength!")
Took my girl and the doggie away
(Folk: "Come on kid, ring the bell!")
Yeah the big strong guy knocked the bell in the sky
(Girl: "Ah, goodbye, muscles, I don't need you anymore")
Took my girl and the doggie away
(Girl: "Loser!")

Why do we have to gamble just to see who's right?

I'm gonna raise a fuss, I'm gonna raise a holler
About a workin' all summer just to try to earn a dollar
Every time I call my baby, and ask to get a date

Sometimes I wonder what I'm a gonna do
But there ain't no cure for the summertime blues

Well my mom and pop told me, "Son you gotta make some money"
If you want to use the car to go ridin' next Sunday
Well I didn't go to work, told the boss I was sick
"Well you can't use the car cause you didn't work a lick"
Sometimes I wonder what I'm a gonna do
But there ain't no cure for the summertime blues
I'm gonna take the weeks, gonna have a fine vacation
I'm gonna take my problem to the United Nations

If your heart hears this melancholy tune
Then you'll know it's the surfer moon
Brings the tide in

Promising to remain for evermore
But they've all disappeared with each new tune

Smell the warm and salty air
See a wave reflect a beam
Stop and find a pretty shell for her
Make it real, your summer dream

To them an ordinary day
Soon you wonder where the time has gone
The sun has almost slipped away

Betsy, Betsy, ahh

She was born in '32, and was she ever pretty
She rode a freight train west, all the way from Detroit city
Betsy's seen more places than I'll ever hope to see
Betsy's been more loyal than any friend could be
With some she traveled fast, with others it was slow
Betsy's seen them all, she'd seen them come and go
She must have had some favorites before I finally met her
And now that she's all mine, they'd better just forget her
Betsy was a lady and that she will remain
Betsy took some beatings but she never once complained
She had a classic beauty that everyone could see
I was the last to meet her, but she gave her life to me
She may be rusted iron, but to me she's solid gold
And I just can't hold the tears back

Met his death while in his car
No one knows the reason why

Cause I'm gonna take a ride with you
We're going down to the Honda shop
I'll tell you what we're gonna do
Put on a ragged sweatshirt
I'll take you anywhere you want me to

Second gear, I lean right (Little Honda, Honda, go faster, faster)
Third gear, hang on tight (Honda, Honda, go faster, faster)
Faster, it's alright

It's not a big motorcycle
Just a groovy little motorbike
It's more fun than a barrel of monkeys
That two-wheel bike
We'll ride on out of the town
To any place I know you like

First gear, it's alright (Honda, Honda, go faster, faster)
Second gear, I lean right (Little Honda, Honda, go faster, faster)
Third gear, hang on tight (Honda, Honda, go faster, faster)

Lean  with me and hang on tight

We know they're right when they say we're not ready

We'll go ahead just the same
Prepare to take the blame

We'll run away and get married anyhow

They warned us that we can't live on love forever
But we just tell them we'll get by somehow
Our problems will be greater
We'll worry about them later
We'll run away and get married anyhow

If other kids went through it
Then I know we can do it
If our love is that much stronger
It will last that much longer
It wasn't too long ago when our folks were
Were going through the same thing we are now

A thing they're not regretting

And it's so close but seems so far away
And yet it comes only once a year
And before you know it, it's already here
The streets are filled with laughter
And so many hearts are gay

The houses turn on their Christmas lights at night

Just to make happy someone like you
And I'll never outgrow the thrill of Christmas day

Frosty the Snowman
Was a jolly happy soul
With a corn-cob pipe and a button nose
And two eyes made out of coal
Frosty the Snowman
Is a fairy tale they say
He was made of snow
But the children know
How he came to life one day
There must have been some magic
In that old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head
He began to dance around
Frosty the Snowman
Was alive as he could be
And the children say
He could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me
Frosty the Snowman
Knew the sun was hot that day
So he said, "Let's run
And we'll have some fun
Now before I melt away"
Down to the village
With a broomstick in his hand
Running here and there
All around the square
Saying, "Catch me if you can"
He led them down
The streets of town
Right to the traffic cop
And he only paused a moment
When he heard them holler, "Stop!"

Had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye
Saying, "Don't you cry
I'll be back again some day"
We three kings of Orient are
Bearing gifts, we traverse far
Field and fountain
Moor and mountain
Following yonder star
Oh, star of wonder, star of might
Star with royal beauty bright
Westward leading
Still proceeding
Guide us to thy perfect light
Born a babe on Bethlehem's plain
Gold we bring to crown him again
King forever, ceasing never
Over us all to reign
Oh, star of wonder, star of might
Star with royal beauty bright
Westward leading
Still proceeding
Guide us to the perfect light
Frankincense to offer have I
Incense owns a deity nigh
Prayer and praising, all men raising
Worship God on high
Oh, star of wonder, star of might

I'm bugged at my old man
Because he's making me stay in my room (Darn my dad)
I came in a little late
And my old man, he just blew his mind (Blew it bad)
Why did he sell my surfboard?
He cut off my hair last night in my sleep

I wish I could see outside
But he tacked up boards on my window (Gosh it's dark)
I can't hit the surf, can't drag
Can't do a doggone thing (Wish I could)
I tried to call up my chick
But he jerked my phone right out of the wall
They gave me some breadcrumbs
And a little glass of water
And they're out there eating steak (Smells so good)

Standing on a mountain looking down on a city
The way I feel is a doggone pity
Teardrops falling down the mountainside
Many times I've been here, many times I've cried
We used to be so happy when we were in love
High on a mountain of love
Night after night I'm a-standing here alone
Weeping out my heart till the cold grey dawn
Praying that you're lonely and you'll come here too
Hoping just by chance that I'll get a glimpse of you
(Oh yeah!)
Trying hard to find you somewhere up above
High on a mountain of love
The mountain of love, the mountain of love
You should be ashamed
You used to be a mountain of love
But you just changed your name

Way down below there's a half a million people
Somewhere there's a church with a big tall steeple
Inside the church, there's an altar filled with flowers
Wedding bells are ringing and they should've been ours
That's why I'm so handy, my dream is gone above
High on a mountain of love
(Keep playing it like it is!)

Wouldn't it be nice if we were older?
Then we wouldn't have to wait so long
And wouldn't it be nice to live together
In the kind of world where we belong?
You know it's gonna make it that much better
When we can say goodnight and stay together

Wouldn't it be nice if we could wake up
In the morning when the day is new?
After having spent the day together
Hold each other close the whole night through
But happy times together we've been spending
I wish that every kiss was never-ending
Oh, wouldn't it be nice?

Maybe if we think and wish and hope and pray, it might come true
Oh, baby, then there wouldn't be a single thing we couldn't do
Oh, we could be married (Oh, we could be married)
And then we'd be happy (And then we'd be happy)

We come on the sloop John B
My grandfather and me
Around Nassau town we did roam
Drinkin' all night
Got into a fight
Well, I feel so broke up
I wanna go home

See how the mainsail sets
Call for the captain ashore, let me go home
Let me go home
I wanna go home, yeah, yeah

The first mate, he got drunk
And broke in the captain's trunk
The constable had to come and take him away
Sheriff John Stone
Why don't you leave me alone? Yeah, yeah

And threw away all my grits
And then he took and he ate up all of my corn

I know so many people who think they can do it alone
They isolate their heads and stay in their safety zones
Now what can you tell them
And what can you say that won't make them defensive?

I know now but I have to find it by myself

They come on like they're peaceful but inside they're so uptight
They trip through their day and waste all their thoughts at night
Now how can I come on

You know you ought to take it slower
But you just can't wait to get to know her

She belongs there left with her liberty
Never known as a non-believer
She laughs and stays in the one, one, wonderful

She knew how to gather the forest when
God reached softly and moved her body
One golden locket, quite young and
Loving her mother and father
Farther down the path was a mystery
Through the recess, the chalk and numbers
A boy bumped into her one, one, one, wonderful
(Laughs and Sounds)
(SMiLE Version Lyrics - "Alternative Verse 4")
All fall down and lost in the mystery
Lost it all to a non-believer
And all that's left is a girl
Who's loved by her mother and father

She'll return in love with her liberty
Never known as a non-believer
She'll smile and thank God for one, one, one, wonderfulYou might also like

She belongs there left with her liberty
Never known as a non-believer
She laughs and stays in the one, one, wonderful

She knew how to gather the forest when
God reached softly and moved her body

Farther down the path was a mystery
Through the recess, the chalk and numbers
A boy bumped into her one, one, one, wonderful
(Laughs and Sounds)
(SMiLE Version Lyrics - "Alternative Verse 4")
All fall down and lost in the mystery
Lost it all to a non-believer

Who's loved by her mother and father

She'll return in love with her liberty
Never known as a non-believer

There's a story told of a very gentle boy
And the girl who wore his ring
Through the wintery snow
The world they knew was one
For their hearts were full of spring
As the days grew old
And the nights passed into time
And the weeks and years took wind
Gentle boy, tender girl
Their love remained still young
For their hearts were full of spring
Then one day they died
And their graves were side by side
On a hill where robins sing
And they say violets
Grow there the whole year round
For their hearts were full of springYou might also like

Bring my baby to me

A boy and a girl they once found love
To each it seemed like heaven above
He looked into her eyes and said
Ooo wee baby you're so good for my head

Oh everyone in every land
Please give me a helping hand
If you see her all alone
Oh tell my baby "won't you please come home?"


Oh bring my baby back

But all I know is that she's gone
Oh bring my baby back to me

Break break shake away
Break breakaway
Now I'm free to do what I want to do

Time will not wait for me
Time is my destiny
Why change the part of me that has to be free
The love that passed me by
I found no reason why
But now each day is filled with the love
That very same love
That passed me by
And that is why
I can breakaway from that lonely life
And I can do what I want to do
And breakaway from that empty life
And my world is new
When I laid down on my bed
I heard voices in my head
Telling me now "Hey it's only a dream"
The more I thought of it
I had been out of it
And here's the answer I found instead
(Baby baby)
Found out it was in my head

And I can breakaway to the better life
Where the shackles never hold me down
I'm going to make a way for each happy day
As my life turns around

Come on we're free to breakaway

In a smaller town

Open cars and clearer stars
That's what I've lacked, oh
But fantasy world and Disney girls
I'm coming back

(Love) Hi Rick and Dave
Hi Pop, good morning, mom
(Love) Get up guess what
I'm in love with a girl I found
She's really swell
'Cause she likes
Church, bingo chances
And old-time dances

All my life I spent the night
With dreams of you
And the warmth I missed
And for the things I wished

It'd be a peaceful life
With a forever wife
And a kid someday

Well, it's earlier nights
And pillow fights

Starting out with Berkeley Free Speech
And later on at People's Park
The winds of change fanned into flames
Student demonstrations spark
Down to Isla Vista where police felt so harassed
They called the special riot squad of the L. A. County Sheriff
Well there's a riot going on
There's a riot going on
There's a riot going on
Student demonstration time
The violence spread down South to where Jackson State brothers
Learned not to say nasty things about Southern policemen's mothers
Nothing much was said about it and really next to nothing done
The pen is mightier than the sword, but no match for a gun
Well there's a riot going on
There's a riot going on
Well there's a riot going on
Cause it's student demonstration time
America was stunned on May 4, 1970
When rally turned to riot up at Kent State University
They said the students scared the Guard
Though the troops were battle dressed
Four martyrs earned a new degree
The Bachelor of Bullets
I know we're all fed up with useless wars and racial strife
But next time there's a riot, well, you best stay out of sight
Well there's a riot going on
There's a riot going on
Well there's a riot going on

Unfolding, enveloping missiles of soul
Recall senses sadly
Mirage like soft blue, like lanterns below
To light the way gladly
Whether whistling heaven's clouds disappear
Whether wind withers memory
Whether whiteness whisks soft shadows away

Feel flows (White puff, glistening, shadowy flow)
Feel goes (Black puff, glistening, shadowy glow)
Unbending, never-ending tablets of time
Record all the yearning
Unfearing, all-appearing message divine
Eases the burning
Whether willing witness waits at my mind
Whether hope dampens memory
Whether wondrous will stands tall at my side

Feel flows (White puff, glistening, shadowy flow)
Feel goes (Black puff, glistening, shadowy glow)

Encasing, all-embracing wreath of repose
Engulfs all the senses
Imposing, unclosing thoughts that compose
Retire the fences
Whether wholly-heartened life fades away
Whether harps heal the memory
Whether wholly-heartened life fades away
Whether wondrous will stands tall at my side

Trying to find a job to fit my trade

And I don't need nobody to pay my aid

Feel the wind burn through my skin
The pain, the air is killing me
For years my limbs stretched to the sky
A nest for birds to sit and sing
But now my branches suffer
And my leaves don't bear the glow

One day I was full of life
My sap was rich and I was strong
From seed to tree I grew so tall
Through wind and rain I could not fall
But now my branches suffer
And my leaves don't offer
Poetry to men of song
Trees like me weren't meant to live

I need a breeze blowing softly
To keep my wind vane from standing
I need a whole lot of sunshine
To keep my sundial advancing
I need some soil before my grass will grow
I need some spark to make my candle glow

I need a mess of help to stand alone
I need a spark by a fire
To stop the cold of my winter

I sailed an ocean, unsettled ocean
Through restful waters and deep commotion
Often frightened, unenlightened
Sail on, sail on sailor

I wrest the waters, fight Neptune's waters
Sail through the sorrows of life's marauders
Unrepenting, often empty
Sail on, sail on sailor
Caught like a sewer rat, alone but I sail
Bought like a crust of bread, but oh do I wail

Seldom stumble, never crumble
Try to tumble, life's a rumble
Feel the stinging I've been given
Never ending, unrelenting
Heartbreak searing, always fearing
Never caring, persevering
Sail on, sail on, sailor

I work the seaways, the gale-swept seaways
Past shipwrecked daughters of wicked waters
Uninspired, drenched and tired
Wail on, wail on, sailor

Always needing, even bleeding
Never feeding all my feelings
Damn the thunder, must I blunder
There's no wonder all I'm under
Stop the crying and the lying
And the sighing and my dying

Sparklin' springs from the mountainside
Join the Big Sur river rushing to the tide
Where my kids can search for sea shells at low tide

An eagle's nest on the head of an old redwood on one of the precipice-footed ridges above Ventana Creek
That jagged country which nothing but a fallen meteor will ever plow
No horseman will ever ride there, and no hunter would cross this ridge but the winged ones
No one will steal the eggs from this fortress
The she-eagle is old, her mate was shot long ago, she has now mated with a son of hers
When lightning blasted her nest, she built it again on the same tree, in the splinters of the thunder bolt
In a broken shack, an old man takes his time about dying
And just at the back, a wild flowerbed that he'll lie in
In dawn's new light, a man might venture
A horse drawn stage from Monterey
The she-eagle is older than I, she was here when the fires of eighty-five raged on these ridges
She was lately fledged and dared not hunt ahead of them, but ate scorched meat
The world has changed in her time; humanity has multiplied, but not here
Men's hopes and thoughts and customs have changed, their powers are enlarged, their powers and their follies have become fantastic
Spilled down the hill, a wagon load of bodies lay scattered
Shipwrecked at sea, limestone ore is all that mattered
They took it from the hills right in through the cargo doors
And how many ships have come and gone at Thurso's Landing shore?

The unstable animal never has been changed so rapidly
The motor and the plane and the great war have gone over him
And Lenin has lived and Jehovah died while the mother-eagle hunts the same hills, crying the same beautiful and lonely cry
And is never tired, dreams the same dreams and hears at night the rock-slides rattle and thunder in the throats of these living mountains
It is good for man to try all changes, progress and corruption, powers, peace and anguish
Not to go down the dinosaur's way until all his capacities have been explored
And it is good for him to know that his needs and nature are no more changed, in fact, in ten thousand years than the beaks of eagles
The eagle's plight, we know that nature's balance is undone
Though it's the birthright of man to unify and live his life as one

Hi
Trader

Trader sailed a jeweled crown
Humanity rowed the way
Exploring to command more land
Scheming how to rule the waves
Trader spied a virgin plain
And named it for velvet robes
Wrote home declaring, "There's a place
Where totally folks are free (Happily completely)
Nourishment fills the prairies and the hillsides
And animals stalk the mountains and the seaside
And fish abound the lakes and birds the skies
Signed sincerely"
Trader found the jeweled land
Was occupied before he came
By humans of a second look
Who couldn't even write their names, shame
Trader said they're not as good
As folks who wear velvet robes
Wrote home again and asked, "Please help
Their breasts I see; they're not like me
Banish them from our prairies and our hillsides
Clear them from our mountains and our seaside
I want them off our lakes so please reply
Signed sincerely"

Trader, he got the crown okay
Cleared humanity from his way
He civilized all he saw
Making changes every single day, say
Shops sprang over the prairies and the hillsides
Then roads cut through the mountains to the seaside
The other kind fled to hide, by and by
And so sincerely cried

Making it softly
Like the evening sea, trying to be
Making it go
Creating it gently
Like a morning breeze, a life of ease
Eyes that see beyond tomorrow
Through to the time without hours
Passing the Eden of Flowers
Reason to live
Embracing together
Like the merging streams, crying dreams
Making it full
Begging intently
For a slight reprieve, a night of ease
Hands to touch beyond the sorrow
On to the force without power
Piercing the crust of the tower
Reason to live
Hoping
Like a budding rose, humbling shows
Making it
Struggling lonely
Like a desert field, break the seal, make it real
Ears to hear beyond the showers
On to the suns of tomorrows
Burning the flesh of all sorrows
Reason to live
Reason to continue
Reason to go on

There was a mansion on a hill
But deep in a secret kingdom
Where a young prince lived
He had four sisters and four brothers
The prince had a special bedroom on the ground floor
With a window that looked down into a deep deep forest
He could see distant lights from other castles in the kingdom
From his window
During the day
He went to school
When it became night
He stayed by himself
Usually in his secret hidden bedroom
One night
While nearly everyone was asleep
He took out of the attic a radio
And he decided to listen to itYou might also like

(In the radio)
Then the prince heard something he never knew could be
The hidden Pied Piper was laughing
As the prince moved his head back and forth with the music going on
When the music died down the Piper said that "every night
After midnight if you leave your on your transistor radio
I'll promise to bring more magic music to you
No one" he said " will ever believe you so why tell of me to anyone?
You are my only friend of night" said the Pied Piper "and I'll talk to
You again some night"
Then the radio was glowing no more
As it fell into the hands of the fascinated prince
He ran back amazed and he hopped right back into bed
That night he dreamt all night
Mostly about his radio and his friend the Pied Piper
The prince did try what the Piper said to do
But for weeks at night
He heard nothing like the music of that magic night
"That Pied Piper must have been joking" he said
"There's nothing but Bach on this radio
I'm gonna throw it back up in the attic for good"
This he sat disbelieving the young prince so loud
That two of his brothers overheard him
The next day those two brothers took the radio from the attic and turned
It onYou might also like

Pied piper, you saw me running along

30 seconds after he was in bed, he fell back to sleep. The next morning he had forgotten all about what had happened the night before. But when night time came once again, his thoughts somehow found their way back to remembering the fascinating episode of the night before
He turned out his bedroom light and sat in his favorite chair. Thoughts danced in his head for a while. "Suppose I went to check and see if my transistor is still down there," he said. "I wonder what would happen."You might also like

As he made his way he could hear something once again

There was that transistor up on the same tree
Then from inside of it came a strange voice

(Nobody knows anything about my existence)
(I only want to know kids)
(Late at night when people are sleeping)
(I go into their old radios and turn them into magic transistors)

"What are you doing there? What is that you're listening too?
Give me that radio at once" she said
A few days later the king and queen of the castle were invited to a ball
As they were leaving that evening the queen said to the young prince
Who was the eldest of the children
"Take care of the other ones tonight
And don't try to find that radio
We have it hidden away
We'll be home by midnight"
And then she said "goodbye"
The children's mother left
And the party had begun
And the children looked everywhere
High and low
Checking to see if they could find that transistor radio
They couldn't find it they couldn't find it
They looked upstairs and downstairs
All through the castle and finally
All of a sudden they heard a sound
What is that sound is it possible
Could it be the Pied Piper himself
Coming out of the magic transistor radio
Or was it just the wind whistling by the castle window

Are you taken by surprise
When your fellow man decides
That what you're doing isn't right
Do you listen, know you're right
Well, you can keep on telling lies
That keep you deaf from people's cries
Well, there's something you should see
We got love to keep us free

We got love, we got love
We got love and we going to change our world, that's right
We got love, we got love
We got love and we going to change our world, that's right
I made my home out in the city
Just to see what I could find
Though my heart was in my country
I was not there to close my eyes
Said, I've been tired of all the same
Must've been a Siren in my head
I've been riding all my feelings
All this running and my temperature won't change

Say, you reap just what you sow
The wise men all have told us so
Trust those feelings deep within
How you must treat your fellow man
Evolution isn't strange
Nature itself demands a change
The universe is on our side

I have no kicks against modern jazz
Unless they try to play it too darned fast
And change the beauty of the melody
Until it sounds just like a symphony

I took my loved one over across the tracks
So she could hear my man wailing sax
I must admit they have a rocking band
Man, they were blowing like a hurricane


Way down south they gave a jubilee

And drinking beer from a wooden cup
The folks dancing got all shook up

Down like a roller coaster
Fast like a loopty loop
Then around like a merry-go-round
We even ate at a hot dog stand
We danced around to a rocking band

The night was so young and everything still
The moon shining bright on my window sill
I think of her lips, it chills me inside
And then I think why does she have to hide

Is somebody gonna tell me why she has to hi-i-ide?
She's passing it by, she won't even try
To make this love go where it should
Doo do doo do do
The sky's turning grey, there's clouds overhead
I'm still not asleep, I'm in my bed
I think of her eyes and it makes me sigh
I think of her voice and it makes me cry

Is somebody gonna tell me why she has to lie-i-ie?
She'd be so right to hold me tonight
Love was made for her and I
Doo do doo do do

It's three o'clock, I go to my sink
I pour some milk and I start to think
Is she asleep or is she awake?
And does she think of the love we could make?

Wake up, call me baby, call me
Tell me what's on your mind
I've got a car and you're not too far
Please let me come over to you

In the middle of your caress
When the day goes down
Honey I'll be around
Why don't you wear your pretty red dress

Here comes the night
Hold me, squeeze me, don't ever leave me
Tell me I'm doing alright
Hold me, squeeze, me don't ever leave me
Tell me I'm doing alright
Hold me, love me, ooooo

I think of going south for the winter
It's getting mighty cold
I watch the fire glow
The moon shining 'cross the snow
Maybe Florida or Mexico
Is where I ought to go

Somewhere where everything is green
Oo the change of scene
Might do a me good
When the swallows go
When they leave Capistrano
Fly away so gracefully
Maybe that's for me
Snowdrifts blowing up against my door
Going clear up to the roof
I could be lying on some sun-washed shore
Truth is, don't know what I'm waiting for

South of the border
Think I'm going south
Get my life in order
Think I'm going south

Mama's little baby loves shortening shortening
Mama's little baby loves shortening bread

Put on the skillet
Slip on the lid

And that ain't all

She's going to cook us some coffee, too
 

I slipped in the kitchen
Raised up the lid
I stole me a mess of that shortening bread
I walked up to a pretty girl and I said
Baby how'd you like some shortening bread

School days
School days
Dear old Golden Rule days

Up in the morning and out to school
The teacher is teaching the Golden Rule
American History and Practical Math
Studying hard and hoping to pass
And working your fingers right down the bone
The guy behind you won't leave you alone
Ring ring goes the bell
The cook in the lunchroom ready to sell
You're lucky if you can find a seat
You're fortunate if you have time to eat
Back in the classroom open your books
The teacher don't know how mean she looks
Soon as three o'clock rolls around
You finally lay your burden down
Throw down your books get out of your seat
And down the halls and into the street
Up to the corner and around the bend
Right to the juke joint you go in
Drop the coin right into the slot
You gotta hear something that's really hot
With the one you love you're making romance
And all day long you've been wanting to dance
Feeling the music from head to toe
And round and round and round you go
Hail hail rock and roll
Deliver me from the days of old
Long live rock and roll
The beat of the drums loud and bold
Rock rock rock and roll

She can make my whole world bright
She brings out the sun at night
She's my sunshine
Life would be full
Sailing on the sea
In a boat
Just a bended knee
And propose
That she'll be my only one

She can make you feel so fine
Like to love her all the time
It's the reason I'm a-pleasing my sunshine

Some-a-day I'm
Going to marry her

Will she squeeze me

When girls get together
They like to talk about their latest love
And their description seems somehow to fit just like a glove
When girls get together
They don't waste time on things like weather and stuff
They all just play around and never seem to discuss it enough
This must have been going on prehistory
They may not ever solve the mystery
But they'll go talk until eternity
When girls get together
And bring up father or brother or men of their lives
It means so much if she's your sister or your mother or your loving wife
I guess we guys might never really know
How good we've got it but we'd like to show
Just how much that we love them so
One bright springtime morning
I overheard an elderly lady's voice
As I walked by her bench she told her friends of her great loss
After they'd gone away
Three little girls came skipping through the park
Talking of little boys and getting home before it's dark

Here in Southern California there is a weather condition known as the Santa Ana Winds

Fire wind
Oh desert wind
She was born in a desert breeze
And wind her way
Through Canyon Way
From the desert to the silvery sea
In every direction
See the perfection
And see the San Gabriel Mountain scene

Santa Ana winds keep blowing across my eyes
Santa Ana winds keep blowing across my eyes

Fill my sails
Oh desert wind
And hold the waves high for me
Then I will come
And test my skill
Where the Santa Ana winds blow free
In waves of elation
My part of creation
Becoming one with the boundless sea


I am the wind
Oh desert wind
On my pilgrimage to the sea
I will prevail
I will not fail
To bring life into humanity
My song is creation
I've been through the nation
Whispering the wisdom and its purity

You might even find them windsurfing too


In the fifties it was "Hey Daddy O"
Then came the surfers and the Hodads you know
We had our woodies and our custom cars
And when we drove around we knew we were bad
My baby listens to my car radio
And when we're cruising lets the whole world know
And when our favorite surfing song comes on
We always let them know it's "Totally Rad!"

Well there's nothing worse than a passing friend
Who will die on you till the bitter end
There's nothing worse than a burning heart
Or a past that tears the world apart

I've been thinking about my situation
Nothing ventured nothing left to lose
When it's easier to just say nothing
I had thought about what I might lose
But through the child's eyes
There were feelings
Touching my violet skin
When the love games start appealing
YOu better get out and move on in

Because there's nothing worse than a passing friend
Or a pioneer of a dying trend
Nothing worse than a silent ghost
Or to lose your head at the starting post

Ain't it always just a short vacation
When it's love it always has an end
Under the sheets of life it's just frustration
While the body goes in search again

And in their haste leave a trail of destruction
And toxic waste is leaving no one safe
In their home or their habitat
Can't let it go like that
Too much consumption and too much greed
When you consider all the people
That are living in need
Interdependence in this world is a natural fact
And we're all under attack
It's the eve of destruction or so they say
But mankind doesn't have to go that way

And we can bring back summer

Spring vacation, good vibrations
Summer weather, we're back together
Easy money, ain't life funny?
Hey, what's it to ya?
Hallelujah

As for the past, that's all behind us
Happier now, look what life finds us
Singing our songs is enough reason
Harmony boys is what we believe in
Some said it wouldn't last
All we can say is we're still having a blast

Spring vacation, good vibrations
Summer weather, we're back together
Easy money, ain't life funny?
Hey, what's it to ya?
Hallelujah

Every night's a special occasion

The private life of Bill and Sue
Can you dig what I'm telling you?
No one knows just why we care
We see their faces everywhere

The strangest story you ever knew
The private life of Bill and Sue

From California to Mexico
Everybody's just got to know
Dallas Texas to Monterey
Wasting time on a sunny day
Santa Barbara to Jersey Shore
At the line in the grocery store
Everybody who ever knew
The private life of Bill and Sue

The private life of Bill and Sue
The world is wondering what they do
We watch them on our TV screen
Their lives are like a movie scene




Sometimes life can be so strange
Maybe we're just looking for a change

Did you ever listen with the music missing
Turn your radio on
When the trees are swaying and the band is playing
Our favorite song
Shelter from the sunlight
Shelter from the cold night

Just where I wanna be
Baby just you and me
Staying at home
Summertime, take a few calls, make a little love
Thank God for shelter

I'll give you shelter from the storm
And a house to keep you warm
I'll give you shelter through the night
And a chance to make this right

Do you ever still think of me
And the way that we used to be
When the world was just you and me
Hanging out in our shelter

Now it's two o'clock
Lines around the block
Waiting for the parade
When the dark of night
Or the bright sunlight
Has you runnin' for shade
Together we can run and hide
Maybe we can stay inside

Do you think that you'd ever stay
Take a page out of yesterday
If we could only find a way
Hanging out in our shelter

Bring back, bring back my baby
Daybreak over the ocean
Moonlight still on the sea
I pray the waves gentle motion
Bring my my baby back to me?
And the stars sprinkle the morning
Venus fades form my sight
Will my love be returning
Like the Sun to brightening over my life?
Days break over the ocean
Moonlight still on the sea
I pray the waves gentle motion
Bring my my baby back to me?
Bring it back
Oh, bring it back
Bring my back my baby

Darling, if you could only
Hear this song in my heart
Then you will know why you need, never feel lonely
We'll soon be together, never to depart
And as long as there is an ocean
Long as stars are to shine
Baby you will always have my devotion, have my devotion
I'll love you pretty baby
Till then end of time


As long as there is an ocean
Moonlight still on the sea
I pray the waves gentle motion
Will bring my baby to me
You might also likeDarling if you should ever
Wonder what you should do
Baby you should know I'll love you forever
Maybe little darling that will see you through
And as the sunset set over the ocean
And the world fades from you
Baby always knew my love and devotion
Will bright up the night
Because I love you

Bring back, bring back
Bring it back
Bring back my baby
Won't you?
Bring back, bring back
Bring it back
Bring back my baby
Won't you bring back my baby?

We got beaches in mind
Man it's been too much time

Woke me up before dawn
Wish I could sleep some more so I could carry on
With the dream I've been meaning to make come true
And that's to get away with you
I think we all can agree
That there's no better place for us to be
We can drive on for miles till we're finally free
It'll just be you and me

South bay surfing again
Haven't been this way in I don't know when
If I have my say we'll be back again
Where the good times never end
We got beaches in mind
Man, it's been too much time
Not a care in the world is where I want to be
With the surfers, sand and the sea
We'll find the place in the sun
Where everyone can have fun, fun fun

On Santa Monica city pier
We watch the people who gather here
The uninvited who've lost their way
And now we're all here to stay

And it's a strange world
There's nothing to it
Strange world
I'm getting through it
Strange world
Thinking it over
It's a strange world after all
Multi-colourful lives we run
To catch a glimpse of the setting sun
I can't imagine how life would be
If you were not here with me


Sunday morning
Skies so blue
Yo te amo
Means I love you
You can drive your car
To the county fair
Or ride your bicycle anywhere
It doesn't matter that much to me
Cause we're pretty good company

Why don't you run away and spend some time with me
On this summer's day, there's nowhere else I'd rather be
Why don't we feel the way we used to anymore
There's a place along the way, that maybe we could stay
And listen to the waves at my front door
You've been thinking 'bout some things we used to do
Thinking 'bout when life was still in front of you
Back where you belong, our favorite song
Won't you listen
Don't you understand the words
Are singing in the wind
I wish that we could get from there to back again
The clouds are breaking, it's a beautiful day
For a wonderful, Pacific coast getaway
The sun is shining, could we just find a way
I you just call, just fall, just fall
To the ground
Through our compromise, paradise
Is just another place up on the wall
Through the common sense of it all
We had a lot to live, we gave it all
Through the consequence of the wine

Sometimes I realize my days are getting on
Sometimes I realize it's time to move along
And I wanna go home
Sunlight's fading and there's not much left to say
My life, I'm better off alone
My life, I'm better on my own
Driving down Pacific Coast, out on Highway One
The setting sun

Summer’s gone
Summer’s gone away
Gone away
With yesterday

Old friends have gone
They’ve gone their separate ways
Our dreams hold on
For those who still have more to say

The nights grow cold
It’s time to go
I’m thinking maybe I’ll just stay


It’s finally sinking in
One day begins
Another ends
I live them all and back again


I’m gonna sit and watch the waves
We laugh, we cry
We live then die
And dream about our yesterdayYou might also like1
