I've been in this town so long that back in the city
I've been taken for lost and gone
And unknown for a long long time
Fell in love years ago
With an innocent girl
From the Spanish and Indian home
Of the heroes and villains

Once at night catillian squared the fight
And she was right in the rain of the bullets that eventually brought her down
But she's still dancing in the night
Unafraid of what a dude'll do in a town full of heroes and villains
Heroes and villains
Just see what you've done
Heroes and villains
Just see what you've done

Stand or fall I know there
Shall be peace in the valley
And it's all an affair
Of my life with the heroes and villains


My children were raised
You know they suddenly rise
They started so long ago
Head to toe, healthy, wealthy and wise

I've been in this town so long
So long to the city
I'm fit with the stuff
To ride in the rough
And sunny down snuff I'm alright

Gentle boy, tender girl

Break break shake away
Break breakaway
Now I'm free to do what I want to do

Time will not wait for me
Time is my destiny
Why change the part of me that has to be free
The love that passed me by
I found no reason why
But now each day is filled with the love
That very same love
That passed me by
And that is why
I can breakaway from that lonely life
And I can do what I want to do
And breakaway from that empty life
And my world is new
When I laid down on my bed
I heard voices in my head
Telling me now "Hey it's only a dream"
The more I thought of it
I had been out of it
And here's the answer I found instead
(Baby baby)
Found out it was in my head

And I can breakaway to the better life
Where the shackles never hold me down
I'm going to make a way for each happy day
As my life turns around

Come on we're free to breakaway
(Oh boy you jump for joy)
Now won't you come on
(When you breakaway)
You're free to breakaways

Better take care of your life
Because nobody else will
They'll twinkle when you fall in love

There is no shuck 'n' jive
I need a mess of help to stand alone
I need a spark by a fire
To stop the cold of my winter
I need a burst of your raindrops
To keep a flow in my river
I need a call for my phone will ring
I need your song for my voice will sing
Please realize
I'm not half alive
Without a mess of help to stand alone

To heat my frostbitten sorrow
I need your hand on my shoulder
To lead today's to tomorrows
I need your strength to lock me to the track
I need your trust to bust the things I lack

Breathing life in to my thoughts

But it's easier for me
To take all the changes that are always amazing
But to never let them fence me in


Me I'm only searching for the things I really need
I can't rely on anyone to sow and grow my seeds
I started out on empty promise I was living on my dreams
I was a runaway son and now I'm up out of the water
And I can barely barely breathe

I sailed an ocean, unsettled ocean
Through restful waters and deep commotion
Often frightened, unenlightened
Sail on, sail on sailor

I wrest the waters, fight Neptune's waters
Sail through the sorrows of life's marauders
Unrepenting, often empty
Sail on, sail on sailor
Caught like a sewer rat, alone but I sail
Bought like a crust of bread, but oh do I wail

Seldom stumble, never crumble
Try to tumble, life's a rumble
Feel the stinging I've been given
Never ending, unrelenting
Heartbreak searing, always fearing
Never caring, persevering
Sail on, sail on, sailor

I work the seaways, the gale-swept seaways
Past shipwrecked daughters of wicked waters
Uninspired, drenched and tired
Wail on, wail on, sailor

Always needing, even bleeding
Never feeding all my feelings
Damn the thunder, must I blunder
There's no wonder all I'm under
Stop the crying and the lying
And the sighing and my dying

Me and mine are going to
Add ourselves to your lengthy list of lovers
And live in canyons covered with a springtime green

And on my old guitar I'll make up songs to sing
Sparklin' springs from the mountainside
Join the Big Sur river rushing to the tide
Where my kids can search for sea shells at low tide

Big Sur, my astrology
It says that I am meant to be
Where the rugged mountain meets the water

An eagle's nest on the head of an old redwood on one of the precipice-footed ridges above Ventana Creek
That jagged country which nothing but a fallen meteor will ever plow
No horseman will ever ride there, and no hunter would cross this ridge but the winged ones
No one will steal the eggs from this fortress
The she-eagle is old, her mate was shot long ago, she has now mated with a son of hers
When lightning blasted her nest, she built it again on the same tree, in the splinters of the thunder bolt
In a broken shack, an old man takes his time about dying
And just at the back, a wild flowerbed that he'll lie in
In dawn's new light, a man might venture
A horse drawn stage from Monterey
The she-eagle is older than I, she was here when the fires of eighty-five raged on these ridges
She was lately fledged and dared not hunt ahead of them, but ate scorched meat
The world has changed in her time; humanity has multiplied, but not here
Men's hopes and thoughts and customs have changed, their powers are enlarged, their powers and their follies have become fantastic
Spilled down the hill, a wagon load of bodies lay scattered
Shipwrecked at sea, limestone ore is all that mattered
They took it from the hills right in through the cargo doors
And how many ships have come and gone at Thurso's Landing shore?

The unstable animal never has been changed so rapidly
The motor and the plane and the great war have gone over him
And Lenin has lived and Jehovah died while the mother-eagle hunts the same hills, crying the same beautiful and lonely cry
And is never tired, dreams the same dreams and hears at night the rock-slides rattle and thunder in the throats of these living mountains
It is good for man to try all changes, progress and corruption, powers, peace and anguish
Not to go down the dinosaur's way until all his capacities have been explored
And it is good for him to know that his needs and nature are no more changed, in fact, in ten thousand years than the beaks of eagles
The eagle's plight, we know that nature's balance is undone
Though it's the birthright of man to unify and live his life as one

Hi
Trader

Trader sailed a jeweled crown
Humanity rowed the way
Exploring to command more land
Scheming how to rule the waves
Trader spied a virgin plain
And named it for velvet robes
Wrote home declaring, "There's a place
Where totally folks are free (Happily completely)
Nourishment fills the prairies and the hillsides
And animals stalk the mountains and the seaside
And fish abound the lakes and birds the skies
Signed sincerely"
Trader found the jeweled land
Was occupied before he came
By humans of a second look
Who couldn't even write their names, shame
Trader said they're not as good
As folks who wear velvet robes
Wrote home again and asked, "Please help
Their breasts I see; they're not like me
Banish them from our prairies and our hillsides
Clear them from our mountains and our seaside
I want them off our lakes so please reply
Signed sincerely"

Trader, he got the crown okay
Cleared humanity from his way
He civilized all he saw
Making changes every single day, say
Shops sprang over the prairies and the hillsides
Then roads cut through the mountains to the seaside
The other kind fled to hide, by and by
And so sincerely cried

Making it softly
Like the evening sea, trying to be
Making it go
Creating it gently
Like a morning breeze, a life of ease
Eyes that see beyond tomorrow
Through to the time without hours
Passing the Eden of Flowers
Reason to live
Embracing together
Like the merging streams, crying dreams
Making it full
Begging intently
For a slight reprieve, a night of ease
Hands to touch beyond the sorrow
On to the force without power
Piercing the crust of the tower
Reason to live
Hoping
Like a budding rose, humbling shows
Making it
Struggling lonely
Like a desert field, break the seal, make it real
Ears to hear beyond the showers
On to the suns of tomorrows
Burning the flesh of all sorrows
Reason to live
Reason to continue
Reason to go on
Reason to live

There was a mansion on a hill
But deep in a secret kingdom
Where a young prince lived
He had four sisters and four brothers
The prince had a special bedroom on the ground floor
With a window that looked down into a deep deep forest
He could see distant lights from other castles in the kingdom
From his window
During the day
He went to school
When it became night
He stayed by himself
Usually in his secret hidden bedroom
One night
While nearly everyone was asleep
He took out of the attic a radio
And he decided to listen to itYou might also like

Then the prince heard something he never knew could be
The hidden Pied Piper was laughing
As the prince moved his head back and forth with the music going on
When the music died down the Piper said that "every night
After midnight if you leave your on your transistor radio
I'll promise to bring more magic music to you
No one" he said " will ever believe you so why tell of me to anyone?
You are my only friend of night" said the Pied Piper "and I'll talk to
You again some night"
Then the radio was glowing no more
As it fell into the hands of the fascinated prince
He ran back amazed and he hopped right back into bed
That night he dreamt all night
Mostly about his radio and his friend the Pied Piper
The prince did try what the Piper said to do
But for weeks at night
He heard nothing like the music of that magic night
"That Pied Piper must have been joking" he said
"There's nothing but Bach on this radio
I'm gonna throw it back up in the attic for good"
This he sat disbelieving the young prince so loud
That two of his brothers overheard him
The next day those two brothers took the radio from the attic and turned

30 seconds after he was in bed, he fell back to sleep. The next morning he had forgotten all about what had happened the night before. But when night time came once again, his thoughts somehow found their way back to remembering the fascinating episode of the night before
He turned out his bedroom light and sat in his favorite chair. Thoughts danced in his head for a while. "Suppose I went to check and see if my transistor is still down there," he said. "I wonder what would happen."You might also like

"What are you doing there? What is that you're listening too?
Give me that radio at once" she said
A few days later the king and queen of the castle were invited to a ball
As they were leaving that evening the queen said to the young prince
Who was the eldest of the children
"Take care of the other ones tonight
And don't try to find that radio
We have it hidden away
We'll be home by midnight"
And then she said "goodbye"
The children's mother left
And the party had begun
And the children looked everywhere
High and low
Checking to see if they could find that transistor radio
They couldn't find it they couldn't find it
They looked upstairs and downstairs

All of a sudden they heard a sound
What is that sound is it possible
Could it be the Pied Piper himself

Well, there's something you should see
We got love to keep us free

We got love, we got love
We got love and we going to change our world, that's right
We got love, we got love
We got love and we going to change our world, that's right
I made my home out in the city
Just to see what I could find
Though my heart was in my country
I was not there to close my eyes
Said, I've been tired of all the same
Must've been a Siren in my head
I've been riding all my feelings
All this running and my temperature won't change

Say, you reap just what you sow
The wise men all have told us so
Trust those feelings deep within
How you must treat your fellow man
Evolution isn't strange
Nature itself demands a change
The universe is on our side
We can't hold back the coming tide

Just let me hear some of that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's got to be rock and roll music
If you want to dance with me

I have no kicks against modern jazz
Unless they try to play it too darned fast
And change the beauty of the melody
Until it sounds just like a symphony

I took my loved one over across the tracks
So she could hear my man wailing sax
I must admit they have a rocking band
Man, they were blowing like a hurricane


Way down south they gave a jubilee
I tell you folks they had a jamboree
And drinking beer from a wooden cup
The folks dancing got all shook up


Say, if you want to dance with me
It's got to be some of that

Fun is in, it's no sin, it's that time again
To shed your load, hit the road on the run again
Summer skies in our eyes and a warmer sun
It's one for all, all for one, all for all out fun

Got to go to it
Going to go through it
Got to get with it
Looking good
Down the hood Of a funky ride
On the way
To the tide
Just to tan your hide
In the shade
Lemonade
In the sun ocean spray
To get your face
In the race
Or lay back's no disgrace


It's OK to get out there and
Have some fun
By yourself maybe
Or else with a special one

To a place called Palisades Park
To have some fun, to see what I could see
That's where the girls are
I took a ride on the shoopty shoop

And when it stopped
She was holding hands with me
My arms were flying up like a rocket ship
Down like a roller coaster
Fast like a loopty loop
Then around like a merry-go-round
We even ate at a hot dog stand
We danced around to a rocking band
And when she winked, I gave that girl a hug
In the tunnel of love
You'll never know how great it just can feel

It's been a long, long while
Since we've been strung out on love
And there's no mask of a smile
That can hide what we're thinkin' of
From your heart I hear
Only distant echoes of empty love
I guess this must be the matchpoint of our love
Early in the game when you broke me
Just like a serve (matchpoint matchpoint)
We shoulda walked off the court
But we both didn't have the nerve (matchpoint matchpoint)
So we volleyed a while with small talk
And a smile and as push comes to shove
I'd say this must be the matchpoint of our love
No one ever held me the way you did
No one could ever love me the way you did
How could love slip away from me?

In life's lonely game love too often
Can let you down (matchpoint matchpoint)
And tho' no one's to blame
Love is stil the only game in town (matchpoint matchpoint)

Ring ring goes the bell

Throw down your books get out of your seat
And down the halls and into the street

Right to the juke joint you go in
Drop the coin right into the slot

And all day long you've been wanting to dance
Feeling the music from head to toe

With a smile she brings me light
She can make my whole world bright
She brings out the sun at night
She's my sunshine
Life would be full
Sailing on the sea
In a boat
Just a bended knee
And propose
That she'll be my only one

She can make you feel so fine
Like to love her all the time
It's the reason I'm a-pleasing my sunshine

Some-a-day I'm
Going to marry her
Some-a-way I'm
Going to carry her
To a place where we can play in the sun

Like a full moon shining bright
She'll light up the darkest night
Will she squeeze me
How she'll please me

When girls get together
They like to talk about their latest love
And their description seems somehow to fit just like a glove
When girls get together
They don't waste time on things like weather and stuff
They all just play around and never seem to discuss it enough
This must have been going on prehistory
They may not ever solve the mystery
But they'll go talk until eternity
When girls get together
And bring up father or brother or men of their lives
It means so much if she's your sister or your mother or your loving wife
I guess we guys might never really know
How good we've got it but we'd like to show
Just how much that we love them so
One bright springtime morning
I overheard an elderly lady's voice
As I walked by her bench she told her friends of her great loss
After they'd gone away
Three little girls came skipping through the park
Talking of little boys and getting home before it's dark

Here in Southern California there is a weather condition known as the Santa Ana Winds

Fire wind
Oh desert wind
She was born in a desert breeze
And wind her way
Through Canyon Way
From the desert to the silvery sea
In every direction
See the perfection
And see the San Gabriel Mountain scene

Santa Ana winds keep blowing across my eyes
Santa Ana winds keep blowing across my eyes

Fill my sails
Oh desert wind
And hold the waves high for me
Then I will come
And test my skill
Where the Santa Ana winds blow free
In waves of elation
My part of creation
Becoming one with the boundless sea


I am the wind
Oh desert wind
On my pilgrimage to the sea
I will prevail
I will not fail
To bring life into humanity
My song is creation
I've been through the nation
Whispering the wisdom and its purity

And that night time holiday scheming
While a lifestyle turns to gold

Hadn't heard it for oh so long
Took me back darling to that time in my car
When you cried all night cause we'd gone too far

Can I ever get you back
Get you back baby
Going to get you back get you back
Get you back get you back baby
Going to get you back get you back
Can I ever get you back
I'm getting tired laying around here at night
Thinking about some other guy holding you tight
He may have money and a brand new car
May even treat you like a movie star
And no matter what he ever do for you
He can never love you like I can do
So if I leave her and you leave him

If everybody in the U.S.A
Could come with us to Californ-i-a
We could take them to a place out west
Where the good sun shines everyday
Now there's a touch of Californ-i-a
In everyone who's ever been this way
And when your telephone begins to ring
And the operator comes on the line

California calling
I'll be there right away
There's some beautiful women
Going to find me one
To show me how to ride the ultimate wave
Now I've joined the surfing nation and so
I'll take a permanent vacation and go
To the golden shores of 'Frisco Bay
I'll ride them all the way to Malibu
And I'll take you boogie boarding with me
Because when we're surfing it's so great to be free
And when you're on a California beach
You might even find them windsurfing too


In the fifties it was "Hey Daddy O"
Then came the surfers and the Hodads you know
We had our woodies and our custom cars
And when we drove around we knew we were bad
My baby listens to my car radio
And when we're cruising lets the whole world know
And when our favorite surfing song comes on
We always let them know it's "Totally Rad!"

Well there's nothing worse than a passing friend
Who will die on you till the bitter end
There's nothing worse than a burning heart
Or a past that tears the world apart

I've been thinking about my situation
Nothing ventured nothing left to lose
When it's easier to just say nothing
I had thought about what I might lose
But through the child's eyes
There were feelings
Touching my violet skin
When the love games start appealing
YOu better get out and move on in

Because there's nothing worse than a passing friend
Or a pioneer of a dying trend
Nothing worse than a silent ghost
Or to lose your head at the starting post

Ain't it always just a short vacation
When it's love it always has an end
Under the sheets of life it's just frustration
While the body goes in search again

Way back when well our master plan
Was havin' fun fun fun as america's band
Well we came out rockin' with rhonda and barbara ann
Singin' of surf and sand
Now when we look back over all the fun we had
If our lifestyle's over now it sure is sad
We gotta get back to livin' without a care
Give me sunshine water and an ozone layer
Paradise is a state of mind
Where mother nature nurtures and man is kind

They chop down the forests
And in their haste leave a trail of destruction
And toxic waste is leaving no one safe
In their home or their habitat
Can't let it go like that
Too much consumption and too much greed
When you consider all the people
That are living in need
Interdependence in this world is a natural fact
And we're all under attack
It's the eve of destruction or so they say
But mankind doesn't have to go that way
If we all get together we can make things right
And we can bring back summer
Get us back our summer
