TranslationsSvenskaDouble Negative (Skeleton Milkshake) Lyrics[Verse]
If you were here for the other night, you'd be terrified
You know, I think the lines you're afraid of are all made up
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
Nobody's gonna regret this for you
If it don't make you smile (Oh)
I watched your skeleton shake all evening
And bless your heart for tryin'

[Pre-Chorus]
Scary watchin' it wearin' off on me so fast
Last night, it was bad
She asked me come back and then I said
[Chorus]
"No problem, I'll send my location"
She hit me four times, I was in the whip before I knew it
Don't cry, when I feel your frustration
I wanna slow it down, but nobody would've let me
If I could've told her, "Maybe if you feel out of place
It's because you are
It's because you are
It's because you are"

[Bridge]
Chippa-cha-cha-changin' right in front of me
Ch-ch-cha-ch-cha-changin' right in front of me
Goin' through phases right in front of my face
Invitin' me to her place, I said
Chippa-cha-cha-changin' right in front of me
Ch-ch-cha-ch-cha-changin' right in front of me
Goin' through phases right in front of my face
Invitin' me to her place, and I said

[Chorus]
"No problem, I'll send my location"
She hit me four times, I was in the whip before I knew it
Don't cry, when I feel your frustration
I wanna slow it down, but nobody would've let me if I could
I told her, "Maybe if you feel out of place
It's because you are
It's because you are
It's because you are"You might also like13Embed
