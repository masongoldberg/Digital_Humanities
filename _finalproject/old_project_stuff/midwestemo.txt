Oh no! I thought you'd changed
Take back all the things you said
I remember thinking this evidence
You left was damning enough
But you took all the words from my mouth
And pulled them out
How could I not see you
For what you are?
But you turned all the words from my mouth
Into doubt
And I wish I could tear your heart out!
Break meter and release, and still the voice it keeps
And I wish that your lungs would give out
And finally give air to breathe
But I know better now
No words can weed you out
When your back's against the wall
You'll be crying out
I'll take all the words from your mouth
And leave them out
And your hands are shaking
Finally, call out!
And the silence breaks your heart
Finally
Oh, I almost pity you now, I almost pity you now
Finally, call out!

Why are my eyes
Always shifting away from anyone
Everyone else's eyes?

A minor case; major depressive
A fantastic film score

"You swore that you would live your life without regret"

Lately, it's been getting late but I'm not tired
And no thanks to
Sleepless nights spent burning with desire
So I'll get in my car

We drove to the shoreline with the check engine light on
We slept in a spare room, sparing no thoughts for our friends
And we're all going straight to hell for all the lies we tell ourselves
Last night
Last night, I wanted to leave all my friends out
Desperate chance dragged me out of the sand
But chance's a certain way of getting stuck
On one small desperate action robbed me of all my good luck
Why did I think I could make it better now?
Why did I think I could keep my feet on the ground?

If I wake up and accidentally crawl into your arms
It's nothing personal, personhood has always seemed so strange
Why do things always have to go and change?
Be better off if things just stayed the same
If I freak out and crash my fucking car into your house
Of course it's personal, personhood has made me feel this way
Why do things always have to go and change?
Be better off if things just stayed the same

Gary and I were skating at a hospital on top of a huge hill overlooking a valley
An ambulance came and took out a dead woman. Gary asked me why she wasn't moving or blinking. They hadn't closed her eyes yet
She must have died on the way. A car full of family and friends came in with the ambulance
They were all crying and hugging each other. One woman screamed hysterically and grabbed at the woman's body asking her to wake up
I had to tell Gary that her soul went to Heaven. I didn't believe a word of it, but I knew it'd be easier for him to understand
Two days from now, at 9 AM, two planes will hit the World Trade Center, killing over 3,000 people
I will tell Gary that there is no God, and all of this is meaningless
But today, there is a God, and he has a plan for him
He doesn't know it, but a year from now, our family will be torn apart and I will move far away and won't see or talk to him for five years
And as we sit on the hood of our car, the sun goes down and he asks me what I want out of my life. I tell him I don't know
 (Sung)
On and on we run away
From the things we are afraid of
On and on we run away

I don't tell him about the dream I had the night before, where I'm riding in a car full of strangers and singing to some song I've never heard and smoking a cigarette and we swerve off the road and hit a tree
I go through the windshield and hit the edge of a fence, dislocating my jaw and flipping me into a wall, where my neck is broken, and my skull is fractured
I bleed to death in excruciating pain
I will have this dream periodically until I meet all of the strangers, one by one introducing them all to each other until we are a close group of friends. I will set these events in motion, and I will die
But today in the warm light of the sunset, I don't see it. I just see the sunset

This to an end, night time turns to dawn
In the corner of your eye
I remember how we listened to our song
In the middle of the night
We
Were too afraid to go to sleep
We
Were too afraid to fall asleep
How it came over me
When I saw your arms
What have you done? (Feel so small)
I saw what you tried to hide
From everyone else
I saw what you tried to hide
From everyone else
I promised you, I promised you
That I would take care of you
I promised you, I promised you
That I would be there for you
I promised you...

That other time when I thought i could be at help
Just like I did
That other time when I thought that I could...

After all, You’re worthless, but I can’t help but care
Can you go on like this for long?
You are efficient, at fucking things up
Go on liken this to all that’s good and right
You’ll find that you go on, like nothing’s wrong
Your pride comes at a cost

I nearly fell in two

"So while you're fixing up your bed
So while you’re organizing drawers
Could you just listen to the problems had
With problems of yours?
And what’s that note you’re writing there?
Why are you giving me this back?
This was a gift from when we met
Back when you weren’t so upset"

I called in sick from your funeral
The sight of your body made me feel uncomfortable
I couldn’t recognize your shell
Your branching off had met an end
From all the weight that made you bend
And when you tried to shed your leaves
You pined for warmth as they said
“Your lack of love for your dear self
Is sapping all of us here out!
Trace your roots back to the ground
Work out the knotholes for yourself”

I called in sick from your funeral
The sight of your family made me feel responsible
And I found the notes you left behind
Little hints and helpless cries
Desperate wishing to be over

You said you’re trapped in your body
And getting deeper every day
They diagnosed you born that way
They say it runs in your family
A conscious erasure of class background
Where despair trickles down
Imbalanced chemical crutch
Open up, swallow down
You said “Remember me for me
I need to set my spirit free”

Empty bottles of wine all over my floor. Did you mean what you said to me last night?
Incognito to mostly all of this shit. Disguised to you as a dead concept
In regards to my faith I’ve been shouting at God through the trees in the woods where you took me to
Where I got lost with you
Held up inside your room at night finding home right beneath your sheets
I loved you and held you tight
Just feels impossible to let you go

I say, stay in there, I'm not going to let anybody see you

There's a bluebird in my heart
That wants to get out but I'm too clever

Yeah I used to live there, used to hang out next door. we would bang our heads until nothing felt so good anymore, and I wonder what is keeping me from going back, is it the fear of change or decision making that I lack?

The smell of industrial paint and magnolia
Fill the warm summer night air
We reminisce old meadows
Once full of life
Now they’re parking lots
Abandoned shopping carts
Crows picking at discarded wrappers
They were empty and pure

And we revel in it

Be ignorant in
Taking romance as a drug
It’s not only killing me)

All my dreams they are gone fleeting like memories
All those kids that i knew back in school have forgotten me
Blood it runs like a river from my eyelids i can't see
The sun setting on the horizon like an incandescent beam

Its everything that you prayed for
Hopeless like the son of man
Every tear that ever hit the ground
Just dries into the land
I'm still tired I've been planning
On sleeping in for weeks
But my thoughts are restless in the dark
I'm dying in this heat
But its my heartbeat that i carry in my chest
Its the sequence of events that brought me to this consequence
I'm still trying to remember things i worried about when i was young
Because not that I'm older my heart can't take the things that I've done
I wrote you three letters that never left my fucking desk
Filled them with words and details of the time we spent
Pouring over every emotion i think i ever felt
Will i ever feel alive will i ever feel something elseYou might also like

You’ve got a funny way of coming clean– or are you just coming apart?
You tuck the to-do lists between the book ends and in the books that look good on the bus
Mistake my wince for a smile while you choke on a bitten tongue
You’re not so funny when you’re mean to me
Your black flags fade to gray– the red-blooded blues
When we grow old to know we died young
Nothing ever lasts
It’s a dystopian, sick world and everything is just falling apart
But don’t it feel like we’re coming together when we load-up the goods and push the shopping carts out?
We’d smoke in your bedroom, where the forced laughter is not contagious
I know that you wish you were sick, but there are so many ways of being more disappointing..
You’re not so funny when you’re mean to me
Your black flags fade to gray, you looked dead in your leather anyway
Suburban Punks and we’re gonna die young

Baby, I know you hate it when I call you that

Where all your ghosts still haunt you just like you feared

Waiting for your return
Your cigarette to burn their whole world through
A thousand things you thought they'd do
Everytime you call I feel worse
Throwing chairs
Stolen rings
Frozen air
And as I walked away I heard you say
"You're not the only one"
And as I watch you sleep it's hard for me
To keep from waking you
To tell you everything I did
And when I listen to you breathe I know exactly what you have always need
You wanted from me
And every time you're here it gets worse
Throwing chairs
Stolen hearts
Tasteless air
I waited all day at the cafe but you never came
But you never came
But you never came
And the hearts of the faithful who died on this table
Have left me with nothing at all to hold onto

Sometimes things just don't work out

Anything you want to hear tonight
Cause I've been drowning in plastic cups

We were kids, we were hopeless
And all we wanted was some sort of constance

Got caught kicking the canvas down
I had plans but they never seemed to work out
Wide-eyed and on the lookout
Got caught tearing the whole thing down
I was halfway done
But then you know this painted scene
Could never leave me
Oh please believe me
Caught killing a camera
Now it seems calming and clear to hire
A cast of kittens, the cats we've been kissing
For the cameras we're lowering here
Got caught tearing the whole thing down
I was halfway done
But then we sang it for Memphis:
The new slang in frame and canvas
Just for the cameras
When we are awake we sing "never ever"
This is where you must make up your mind
Should beauty be design this time?
This time you decide cause we go with whatever
We take our time
Got a cough
My throat kills from singing
My ears are ringing
The stage is slowly sinking
And we're all thinking the same thing
Let's not settle for satisfaction
We are women and men of action
Let's stop clapping, let's start doing

A brave morning, thoughts flap their wings and fly
And I can still taste defeat on my lips
Bright tie, fish fly, I have not yet arrived
How can I not admit, I need to know you

'Cause I just want to be something more than the mud in your eyes
I want to be the clay in your hands

Hey sorrow, where are you?
Tomorrow just won't be the same without you here
I'll wish for shoulders bold and broad to bear
And strength to hold my head above them
'Cause I just want to be something more than the mud in your eyes
I want to be the clay in your hands

Die alone if it helps you through the year

“I’ll see you again”
So when will I see you again?

You were born on a leap year, fill in the gaps
Spinning gears, keep catching your cracks
Skipping teeth, keep calling you back
Telling stories pretending they’re fact
Let me go, too unstable to wane
Chewing wildflowers to numb the pain

Cut the lines, you’ll be fine
But if you break when I break, will you carry me away?
Will you fall on your blade just to hear when I’m saying I can’t?
You came out, started bruising
Find it tough to admit when you're losing
Oh, what should I think?
Carefully crafted commercial disaster
They take what you’re after
To get what they want out of you

Cut the lines, you’ll be fine
But if you break when I break, will you carry me away?
Will you fall on your blade just to hear when I’m saying I can’t?

Dissociate from touch, you’re tilting to pull
The others with you, posed Shakespearean skull
We see in different pictures
You play the imperial, stealing the power to waste away
You took the comfort from the lights in her soul
Projected map of the body: it's crass, abject, colonial
You passed; disease presented to you at birth
Held underwater, told to scream your self-worth
It wasn’t good enough
Entrust the secrets to the backs of your arms
Killing the self as to protect it from harm

Thought I'd write to you
And let you know that I'm still dramatic and sixteen
I thought I'd call you
And tell you that I'm still miserable without you

I thought I could find you
At the bottom of a plastic cup but like we both knew
Nothing ever helps the swelling inside our chests
There's nothing left
Now we'll visit our love like a long lost monument
Forever forgotten

What I say is what I get
I’m just tongue-tied
Waiting in the back of my mind is “You’re not worth it”
A daily dose of my own regret
And unsaid feelings that I won’t forget
So I speak the truth into empty cans and bottles
(It’s a problem)

The definition of a diary but put into a song
Everything I ever meant to say but always said it wrong
Every day I dial your number, I just never make the call
It’s like standing on the edge so I can contemplate the fall
Did you forget you said forever when I asked how long you’d stay?
And that we’d always make it better if it ever went astray?
I guess that liars aren’t compatible, that’s why we parted ways
It doesn’t change the fact I still believe in everything you say
So I’ll contemplate the fall

Driving around your home town with all four windows down, I've been watching the odometer and thinking about geography, and the couple thousand miles of barren country constantly dividing you and me
Or hiding out in the basement where we used to make out and constantly complain about the circumstances we found ourselves in when we were just two kids, both just too proud to admit, just how fortunate we were to have come across each other
Nothing's made sense like that made sense since

Back to the same three days
Over and over again
Fraction of zero sum

All the regret I keep
All the mistakes I dread
Exhausted from oversleep
Awake but still in bed
Ashamed of the things I've said
Afraid of what's in my head
So under this bridge I'll stay
And wait for the same three days to end
I sob when I speak
They're looking at me
But I can't tell what they see
My thoughts slow to a crawl
I embrace the fall
So I won't answer your calls
It wasn't always this way:
Perpetually in the gray
Solace in empty fate
The years evaporate
But within the harsh spotlight
I bury myself inside
'Cause every time that I think
I let you go
They will construct this maze
Of fear that I navigate
I'll attempt to parse my place
You'll define everything
I'll finally shut my mouth
Feel both my feet touch ground
Put an end to this run
Just say the word and I'll jump
"To everyone: Yeah, you were right
I'll never get better and I'm sorry

I'll be at peace because it's not 'want,' it's 'need'

The last time I stole my father's keys
I couldn't have been older than nineteen
I hightailed his car from New Jersey to Willow Grove

And you could not see their street signs through the smoke

Between the dumpster diving, vandalizing
Suburban streets and disturbing the peace
Everything we passed, we smashed
It was broken pavement and shattered glass
And you could not read the street signs through the smoke
Just afterthoughts passing all of the laws we broke

Considered violent and reckless by North Philly detectives
We occupied the space where we'd never have a thing to lose
Between the bong rips and knife hits
Protestant booze, stick-and-poke tattoos
We were just over-privileged youth seeking something to do

And you'll probably just be pissed and I, I didn't even think of it

Remember winter?
We looked so young then
It felt like summer
As cold hit our skin
And as the sun dropped
We'd watch the moon rise
And as the night froze, we'd live out our lives
But winter ends
And new leaves grow
But now I'll never, never, never, never let this go
The way things felt
When things turned cold
Our bodies freezing as our hearts turned cold

Grief creeps quietly backwards

Who spat on your gold-plated silverware
And due to the lack of a rationale
You were left near bereft in the birth canal
But it was your time to shine, your time to actuate
But you were falling behind when they could stand up straight

You tried your hardest, but they won’t ever be satisfied

Immediate incision, you were expected to bleed

And it all falls down around me
And hits me in the face and falls onto the ground
And I wish that I could understand
Why I'm so upset to see these things I'll never have
My hands shake with anger
And my eyes fill up with tears that taste like salt
And it's hard to get up; too hard to pick myself up off the ground
Laughing at me, if I could, if I could
(I was lost at sea and you let me drown, you let me)
Laughing at me, if I could, if I could
(I was lost at sea and you let me drown, you let me)
Wondering by myself, if I could, if I could
(I was lost at sea and you let me drown, you let me)
To walk for miles
And let the rain soak me until I smile
It's getting late, but I don't mind
I'm holding onto hands as drenched as mine
And, for the first time in my life, I want to cry
And laugh at the same time
And I'm happy, and I'm happy, and I'm happy
(How could you say no?)
Because this space has been filled, this space has been filled

Makes a heart filled with void remembers the
Aching

And everything I didn't say echoes forever
You never saw how much you hurt me, I guess
But then again
Thousand twinkling lights
In a September night sky
Makes my heart slowly wander and stumbles across
The aching
Of a loss

Sound of things that break

Hiding in burrows disguised as Babylon

Because it’s all that comforts me in stagnancy

Hey Dave, isn’t it about time you finally grew that fucking spine?
(Or an even line?)
Doesn’t it only make things worse
Writing your agonies down in verse?
Shouldn’t you destroy all those notes and rants before they all destroy you first?
Hasn’t it become a curse?
No, I still cling to notes
The raving rants I wrote are kept close
They’re archived and filed, or memorized in hopes
That they may leave a trail which, backwards, leads to where things went wrong
And the instructions to repair the pride I broke
(Cause lord knows, they’ve got to be good for something)
And so I’ve cataloged each moment and placed them within a timeline
Composed of thoughts, regrets, and stories that I keep stored within my mind
And I know they may not mean much within the scope and scale of life
Although, for now, they’re all I have, and dammit they’re all mine

But I won't always be around
You better take your chance right now
These empty parking lots
Oh, they melt my thoughts
Waiting for you to find

Your spot is right next to mine
Your spot is right next to mine
Your spot is right next to mine

I know it’s hard to talk about life like a Luftwaffe pigeon
But they’re dive bombing us with all their shit
So try to make a game of living
Of laughing, lying, and breathing
Kid you need to take the good with the bad or it’s all just a drag
And your old and your dead inside
Like your parents were before the war
Before the shit hit the fan
You’re still living and loveless
But it’s hopeless feeling that heartless
She’ll keep wishing on stars
And praying to god
You can’t change the way things are sometimes
All the while you’ll keep hoping
You’ll keep both eyes open
And someday you’ll remember what it’s like
To be one half of the wholeYou might also like1
You never deliver
In the times when I need you
If you're tired from the day
I don't blame you
But still I need you to follow through
Late at night
You and I never work out quite right
You never want me to do anything
And when I'm in the mood I think you're pretty rude
When I'm full of energy you don't see me
I'm trying to be serious and you're just laughing
Late at night
You and I never work out quite right
Late at night
You and I never work out quite right
I'm getting better at listening
But I don't know where you go late at night
And when I've moved along
You suddenly can't seem to get enough of what we had
Late at night
You and I never work out quite right
Late at night
You and I never work out quite right
Late at night
You and I never work out quite rightYou might also like

I think cancers gonna kill me
'Cause I got a real bad sunburn when I was 13
Couldn’t sit in a classroom chair for at least a week
Maybe I shouldn’t have fallen asleep
In that hot, hot sun without a little bit of sunscreen
Don’t let this reflect too badly on my character

I think a car is gonna kill me 'cause I ride my bike consistently throughout the city
And we all know, it's only so long before you get hit
But on that idea, I’m getting more used to it
I don’t care to think about it twice
Maybe I should just be a little more kind
Is it fear or awareness that keeps me alive?
Maybe I should just be a little more kind

I think a plague is gonna kill me 'cause my body cannot fight off all the bugs that are in me
We all know I’m pretty good at getting sick
Maybe I’ll continue to age and the reaper keeps a distance until I am old one day
But I’m not sure that I’d honestly prefer that
It's not a matter-of-fact, but rather something to look at

I don’t care to think about it twice
Maybe I should just be a little more kind
Is it fear or awareness that keeps me alive?
Maybe I should just be a little more kindYou might also like1
Forty more than I can take today
Wrap it up in cellophane
Throwing out for safety's sake
'Cause they'll just think it sounds the same
(Chorus)
I'll go a day
I'll go a day
I've gone for days
I know a way
I know the way
But I can't speak
And if I stay
Well I'll have to make this up
Sixteen days to find a way
To try and get this shut
And I'll be gone
So I'll be safe
Busy scratching out this ache
Taking pressure off my face
We'll throw this out for safety's sake
(Chorus)
I'll go a day
I'll go a day
I've gone for weeks
I know a way
I know a way
But I can't speak
And if I stay
Well I'll have to make this up

I'm feeling numb
Check my trajectory
I'm out of air to breathe
I'm feeling dumb
In a pyramid
God's shaking in his sleep
With a golden thumb
He will press me down and break all of my teeth
Just the sum
Of a broken chart, red hearts I love to leave
Why
Why can't I fucking do this
Lie to myself
Just vibe to the fucking music
Why
Why am I so fucking stupid
Yeah I've got a problem
No I won't solve it
Drink another drink while my liver resolves it
I've got a fucking disease
I'll stomp your head till it buckles and bleeds
I've got a fucking disease
I'll beat you down and give you scrapes on your knees
I've got a fucking diseasе

Uh oh
There goes the neighborhood
Just like you thought it would
Before everything we knew started to fall apart
Go on grow up you’re an adult now
Don’t you want to make your parents proud
At the expense of everyone you know?
Everybody knows what we did alone
And there’s no way of hiding from it now
This wasn’t important to me
Now I’m lying on your floor
Telling you what's on my mind
Because I just couldn’t hold them in anymore
What was the point if we both gave up?
What was the point if we both think we fucked up
And we can’t figure out what we fucked up on?
If the neighborhood floods
Are you gonna drag me up
Or leave me to drown the way you left your friends?
Do you think that I’m stupid?
Do you think I’m weak?
Do you think this is pointless like everything?
It’s the way that I feel all the time!
Do you feel how I feel all the right time or no...?
Can you make it on your own?You might also like
