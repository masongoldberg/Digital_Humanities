    "This Programming Historian lesson dealt with understanding sentiment analysis in text and how to use the Natural Language ToolKit to parse text corpuses for sentiment scores. In this example by Programming Historian, I looked at email messages from the Enron Scandal of the early 2000s, and looking at how those messages were positive or negative in sentiment. I also used one message that Prof. Saxton sent earlier today to analyze the sentiment analysis of that message. \n",
    "\n",
    "It was cool to see how easy it is to use something that is very clearly technologically advanced, but with instructions and easy downloads is fairly seamless and simple. There were certainly some issues I noticed with the ToolKit, as far as it not being able to understand the contexts of human interaction-- such as, the phrase “I am having trouble understanding your logic here” in a corporate email shows much more frustration and contempt that it would in say, an email from a professor to a student in a homework evaluation. For the program, though, the words are the same, so it would have the same score. \n",
    "\n",
    "I can see some really pertinent uses of this kind of program in understanding social media trends, and governments using it to control their population, which is something I’m thinking a lot about in the wake of the Iran protests. I could see a government using sentiment analysis to try to police their populations with respect to how they talk about the government and their policies online, which could be a huge threat to freedom of speech and expression around the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "As for personal use, I am interested in running this program over my own personal text messages with friends and family to see how my friends interact with me-- to see who interacts with me positively and negatively. I don’t know what I would do with this information, but it could be really interesting to know and would be a good way to use this program in a way that is pertinent to me. \n"
