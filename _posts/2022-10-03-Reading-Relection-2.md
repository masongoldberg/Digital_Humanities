Reading a chapter from Edward Gibbon, and having taken a class on Byzantine history previously, I am thinking a lot about the way that Gibbon chooses to portray history and give the reader a picture of the history of the “fall of the Roman Empire,” and how that portrayal compares to modern day history books. I know that The Decline and Fall was for the longest time the preeminent source on Byzantine history, and in many ways still holds a lot of power and stature in the study of Byzantine history. In reading excerpts of chapters from the book, it’s interesting to see how he chooses to portray certain events. He may spend a long time talking about a particular dream that a ruler had, or an episode of one night of their life, and then just totally gloss over other historical battles or things that we might think of as being of greater importance. Gibbon essentially tries to tell a story in the way that fiction is written, giving a lyrical and florid account of about a thousand years of history—I feel like this differs from a lot of the ways that we see history being written about today, with a much more academic viewpoint, where the voice of the author isn’t that strong in the writing of the details of history. 
Another big takeaway I have from these readings is understanding the bias and kind of agenda that Gibbon had going into writing his volumes about the Byzantines. I mean, it’s right there in the name. Even though this is a history of the long-lasting and at many points quite successful Byzantine Empire, it is called the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, clearly putting a Western European bias upon his history. I think this shows me how even though academic writing is supposed to be unbiased, and that many people over the years have probably thought that Gibbon’s account was a good and academic one, there are always biases in writing of all kinds, and that research always has an author. When we look at research of any kind, we must be able to understand who is producing that research, what biases and agendas the researchers may have, and how they have researched and showcased their subjects given those biases. This is something that I will take with me when evaluating future research and digital humanities projects in the future—I think that taking a critical look at the language that is used to promote and showcase research is incredibly valuable in understanding the research itself, and understanding the successes and limitations of research by an individual person or group that exists in a certain place and time in history.
One question that I have given these readings, is, what would an unbiased and more leveled approach to studying history look like, especially with technology? Could some sort of technology be used to analyze some era of history, or even look at human history going forward, that might eliminate some biases from the research? Or, is bias and a standpoint somewhat necessary to the existence of historical research—put otherwise, why do we study history if not to square it with our own personal biases and viewpoints?
